# Hangman Game

This is a simple Hangman game built with React. The objective of the game is to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. You have a limited number of guesses before the game ends.

## Rules of the Game

1. The game will choose a random word from a dictionary.
2. You need to guess the letters in the word by clicking on the available letter buttons.
3. If the letter is present in the word, it will be revealed in the display.
4. If the letter is not in the word, your remaining guesses will decrease.
5. You win the game if you successfully guess all the letters in the word.
6. You lose the game if you run out of remaining guesses.
